The object-oriented programming paradigm relies on the two following fundamental rules:

Anything of the real (or mathematical) world which needs to be manipulated by the computer is modeled by an object.
Each object is an instance of some class.
At this point, those two rules are a little meaningless, so letâ€™s give some more or less precise definitions of the terms:

object
a portion of memory which contains the information needed to model the real world thing.
class
defines the data structure used to store the objects which are instances of the class together with their behavior.

To define some object, you first have to write a class. The class will define the methods and the attributes of the object.

method
particular kind of function associated with an object used to get information about the object or to manipulate it.
attribute
variable where information about the object is stored.
