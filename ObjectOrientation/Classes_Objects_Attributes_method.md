Anything of the real (or mathematical) world which needs to be manipulated by the computer is modeled by an object.
Each object is an instance of some class.<br>
**object:**<br>
a portion of memory which contains the information needed to model the real world thing.<br>
**class:**<br>
defines the data structure used to store the objects which are instances of the class together with their behavior.<br>

To define some object, you first have to write a class. The class will define the methods and the attributes of the object.
**method:**<br>
particular kind of function associated with an object used to get information about the object or to manipulate it.<br>
***attribute:**<br>
variable where information about the object is stored.<br>
