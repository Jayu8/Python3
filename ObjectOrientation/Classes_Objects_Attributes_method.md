Anything of the real (or mathematical) world which needs to be manipulated by the computer is modeled by an object.
Each object is an instance of some class.
**object:**
a portion of memory which contains the information needed to model the real world thing.
**class:**
defines the data structure used to store the objects which are instances of the class together with their behavior.

To define some object, you first have to write a class. The class will define the methods and the attributes of the object.
**method:**
particular kind of function associated with an object used to get information about the object or to manipulate it.
***attribute:**
variable where information about the object is stored.
