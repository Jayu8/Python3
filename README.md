1. You should only use StudlyCaps for class names. 
2. Constants should be IN_ALL_CAPS with underscores separating words. 
3. Variable, method, and function names should always be snake_case (wonder where it got that name?). 
4. You'll see camelCase in some really old Python code but it's not the modern convention at all.
