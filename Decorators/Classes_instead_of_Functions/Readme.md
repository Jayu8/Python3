We will rewrite the following decorator as a class: 
```
def decorator1(f):
    def helper():
        print("Decorating", f.__name__)
        f()
    return helper

@decorator1
def foo():
    print("inside foo()")

foo()
```
The following decorator implemented as a class does the same "job": 
```
class decorator2(object):
    
    def __init__(self, f):
        self.f = f
        
    def __call__(self):
        print("Decorating", self.f.__name__)
        self.f()

@decorator2
def foo():
    print("inside foo()")

foo()
```
Both versions return the same output: 
```
Decorating foo
inside foo()
```
