What's the difference between lists and dictionaries?<br>
A list is an ordered sequence of objects, whereas dictionaries are unordered sets. <br>
But the main difference is that items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position.<br>
Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables.<br>
