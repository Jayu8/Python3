**Dictionary**<br>
Dictionaries are **unordered** sets<br>
Unlike Lists items in dictionaries are accessed via **keys** and not via their position.<br>
Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables.<br>
**Syntax:**  dict = {"key":value}  #flower brackets<br>
**Key** : Must be immutable (string , tuple etc)<br>
**Value**: Values can be arbitrary (list ,dictionaries, ANYTHING etc )<br>

**Sets**<br>
set is an **unordered** collection with **no duplicate** elements.<br>
**Sets cant contain immutable objects**<br>
1)But,Sets can be mmutable ( only their internals need to be fixed)<br>
2)Frozen sets are not mutabale (completely immutable unlike sets)<br>
**Syntax:**  SET = set{"value"}  #OR simply SET = {"value"}<br>
