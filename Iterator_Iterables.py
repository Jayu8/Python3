"""
Behind the scenes, the for statement calls iter() on the container object. 
The function returns an iterator object that defines the method __next__() which accesses elements in the container one at a time. 
When there are no more elements, __next__() raises a StopIteration exception which tells the for loop to terminate.

""""
An iterable is a object which has a __iter__() method.
It can possibly iterated over several times, such as list()s and tuple()s.It returns an iterator object
An iterator is the object which iterates. 
It is returned by an __iter__() method, returns itself via its own __iter__() method and has a __next()__ method.
Iteration is the process of calling this __next__() until it raises StopIteration
