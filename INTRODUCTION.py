Python offers a comfortable command line interface with the Python shell, which is also known as the "Python interactive shell". 

Python Internals:
Python is both an interpreted and a compiled language.
Python code is translated into intermediate code, which has to be executed by a virtual machine, known as the PVM.

Variables and data types:
As variables are pointing to objects and objects can be of arbitrary data type, variables cannot have types associated with them
x=42. here x is a variable which REFERENCE this newly created object to any data type in this case to int. 42 is an object.  

Sequence Types â€” str, unicode, list, tuple, bytearray, buffer, xrange:
String- methods, formatting 
List[] -mutable - push pop peek append,exrend,remove
Tuple() -immutable

Deep and shallow copy:
Usually shallow copy that is x=y point to same object , deep copy seperate objects (C like)

Input:
eval(input("Please enter"))    #eval converts input to desired datatype

Print => format method.  
print("The capital of {province} is {capital}".format(province="Ontario",capital="Toronto"))
